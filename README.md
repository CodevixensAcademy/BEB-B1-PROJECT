# BEB-B1-PROJECT
*The project for the PHP Backend beginner track (Band 1) for Codevixens Academy*

## Project Goal 
Using procedural or Object Orientated PHP and very basic HTML form elements, create a contact form which will submit content to display on the next page.

## Introduction
A form often needs to be used to pass data to various other applications. In many cases, it could be a database, in others, it may be to give a specific answer or a quote. Regardless of how the information may need to be used, it is an important skill to be able to move data to new pages so it can be manipulated for use in further code. For this project, you will create a HTML web form.

## Requirements
The form should consist of:

- A text input for user’s name.
- A text input for user’s email address.
- A drop down to select user’s issue (Query, Feedback, Complaint, Other)
- A text area for user’s comment.
- The form will post to a second page which will display the information in an easy to read format.
- Add a submit button on the second page which will save the response to a database table.

## Suggested Implementation
*Either Local web server such as XAMPP or WAMP Or Web hosting*

Also
- Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to create forms
- Basic PHP knowledge of using variables and POST content.
- As we are working with PHP which is a server-side language, we require the use of either a local web server (Free) or a web hosting package (Low cost) in order for us to run the code.
- The majority of the functionality will be passed with PHP. HTML will allow us to create the form and the webpage structure while the CSS will give us the ability to style the HTML

## References
- This project requires very few resources that are all freely available and easy to set up.

*To encourage good practice:* \
*1. Validate the input in the email field to ensure it's an email format.*\
*2. Make fields required - ensure feedback is given to the user if an input is missing.*
